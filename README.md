changes colors of icons of halos to more black and white part of Black Code Book Project

{Problem?   Well different computing environments have different psychological  ambients so why choose one color scheme for all, users can create their own scheme.  Context of where your computing matters.  
This can  be done in preferences but this helps to fix things in a more direct style that the user knows what wants to change. This helps give a starting point  where users can start.    Some people like black and white some like pink, so this attempt to solve that issue.   Users can feel change it suit their comfort so they can focus more on what they want to do."  

what? change colors in squeak halos when? anytime where? look at the methodName below who? for all why? sometimes like windows to more black colors and some white as well. Part of the black code book project.

Also if you want to customize to what you want. its nice to see how the squeak team laid this out.

So to test you need to load the icon halo type in the preferences under halo . hit load to make it happen it should.
